  *OSY - Optimized Stable Yield*
## Overview
The smartest stablecoin yield aggregator, providing maximum optimized returns across DeFi protocols and blockchains.

- Powered by Account Abstraction (AA), our platform makes DeFi as easy as Web2.
- Users can deposit stablecoins in a single click, and our smart routing system automatically allocates assets across multiple chains and protocols to capture the highest APYs in real time.
-  No gas, no complex transactions â€” just effortless, optimized yield generation.

 OSY (Optimized Stable Yield) redefines stablecoin investing by automating yield optimization seamlessly across all DeFi protocols and blockchains. Users effortlessly deposit stablecoins via their personalized Smart Wallet, instantly receiving osyUSD, an interest-bearing stablecoin representing their dynamically managed investments.
> 

 Funds reside safely within dedicated, blockchain-specific OmniVaults, carefully managed through our powerful Position Handler. This handler communicates seamlessly between vaults and top-yielding DeFi protocols, executing intelligent deposits and timely withdrawals according to optimized investment paths. 

 APY Radar continuously scans and detects the highest-yielding opportunities in real-time across all available chains, feeding data directly to YieldBrain, our sophisticated optimization engine, which dynamically recalibrates your asset allocations for maximum returns.
 
 At the core of OSY sits OSY Core, the authoritative smart contract that accurately calculates total accrued interest from all vaults, securely minting and managing osyUSD tokens. It periodically applies the accumulated yield directly to users' balances, compounding returns effortlessly. 

 Users interact seamlessly via their intuitive Smart Wallet, gaining complete transparency and control over their investments.
